# CryptoApp
The cryptocurrency data that is used in this app comes from a free API from CoinGecko prices may be slightly delayed.
This app was developed by Xavier JD. It usses SwiftUI and is written 100% in Swift. The project benefits from multi-threading, publishers/suscribers and data persistance
